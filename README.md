# learngit_again
I learnt git/github a year ago and created the repository named "learn git", but Iâ€˜ve forgotten a little bit about the operations of git/github now, so I create the learning reposityory again to be familiar with the operations of git and github again. After all, git is  currently the most adcanved distributed version control system of the world.
