# learngit_again
## what does the word "again" mean?
I learnt git/github a year ago and created the repository named "learngit", but I can remember little about the operations of git/github now, so I create the learning reposityory again to be familiar with the operations of git and github again. After all, git is currently **the most advanced distributed version control system** of the world. 

## what's inclued?
The content of this project is mainly in the "learn-git.txt" file, and I also prepared a Markdown file for you to read conveniently. This file contains some of the most commonly used operations of Git & GitHub and problems I met when I was learning. And if you find something wrong in the content, please submit a pull request and I will certainly process it as soon as possible. 

## Reference
This project mainly refers to the course of Mr.Liao Xuefeng. And [here](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/896043488029600) is a link to his website.
